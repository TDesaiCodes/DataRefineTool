This repository contains a Python project that automates basic data cleaning tasks to prepare datasets for analysis. It helps:

Handle missing values (fill with mean/median/mode)

Remove duplicate rows

Detect and remove outliers using the IQR method

Convert categorical/text columns into numeric format

Provide a summary of the dataset including statistics (.describe())

This tool is simple, practical, and useful for anyone working with real-world data to ensure clean and reliable datasets before analysis.
